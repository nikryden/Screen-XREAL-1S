# Project Status

> Read this first. Update it at the end of every task (see skill `docs-handoff`).

## Current
- **Milestone:** M4/M5 (workspace in the app) — **mostly done**; M6 started (crash-safe restore). Last updated 2026-09-29.
- The app is usable end to end: Start menu → **XrealScreen** → Home → **Start workspace**.

## Done
- M0–M3: protocol, virtual monitors, capture, head-tracked rendering (see ROADMAP).
- **Two workspace types** (Screens page, ADR-0010):
  - **Glasses anchor** (user's preferred): glasses OSD Anchor + UltraWide; app splits the glasses image into 1–3 pixel-exact virtual screens with a gap (default 10 px) and aspect (16:9 default); preview picture + **Apply screen settings** button; auto-restart when the glasses UltraWide changes.
  - **App head tracking**: curved screens, stabilizer presets (default Strong), tracking axes (default Turning + level; Full is most comfortable per user), neck model, Ctrl+Alt+Plus/Minus distance, desk refresh sync.
- Engine hardening: no NaN before the first IMU sample, watchdog for glasses re-enumeration, catch-all session errors, forced virtual-monitor resolutions (fixes SetDisplayConfig 87), crash log `%LOCALAPPDATA%\XrealScreen\crash.log`.
- **Tray + background (M6)**: tray icon (Open / Start / Stop / Recenter / Exit), close-to-tray, Ctrl+Alt+W toggles the workspace, Start with Windows (MSIX StartupTask, starts hidden in tray); app preferences in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\XrealScreen\app.json`.
- **Installer (M7 phases 1 + 2)**: `installer\driver\Build-Driver.ps1` → `artifacts\driver\` (virtual-display-rs 0.4 built from source, signed with a separate test certificate); `installer\Build-Package.ps1` → `artifacts\installer\` (signed self-contained MSIX + driver + scripts). Install keeps an existing driver, otherwise asks and installs ours ([verified-local]: keep-existing path; fresh install not yet tested).
- **Less lag + no nod bobbing (App head tracking)**: gyro-speed stabilizer, 20 ms prediction (ADR-0009), tilt correction only when the head is nearly still (ADR-0007 `RateGate`) — verified with the user in the glasses.
- **Crash-safe restore**: at app start (and `xrs recover`) leftover virtual monitors are removed and layout + refresh rates restored ([verified-local] hard-kill test).
- **Settings + workspaces (M6)**: all settings autosave (0.5 s after a change) and load at start (theme too); named workspaces (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\XrealScreen\workspaces\<name>.json`, Home page: save / load / delete / import / export one JSON bundle, `WorkspaceLibrary`); **Exit** item in the navigation footer quits for real. Not yet tested by the user.
- **Glasses connect / primary / windows (M6, 2026-09-29, not yet tested on hardware)**: Settings "Workspace to start automatically" (latest settings or a saved workspace; `AppPreferences.AutoStartWorkspaceName`) used by "Start it when XrealScreen starts" and "Start it when the glasses are connected" (app polls the glasses monitor every 2 s); Screens "Primary monitor while the workspace runs" (`WorkspaceOptions.PrimaryScreen`, layout shifted so that virtual screen is at 0,0; original layout restored on stop); "Move windows from the glasses display" (`WindowMover`, default on; elevated apps' windows cannot be moved).
- **UltraWide guard (2026-09-29, not yet tested on hardware)**: Glasses anchor with UltraWide Off does not start; Home shows a warning, the tray shows a balloon, and the app starts the workspace once the glasses report an UltraWide signal (2 s poll + 2.5 s settle); Stop cancels the wait.
- **Glasses screenshots (2026-09-29)**: Home **Screenshot** button, tray item and **Ctrl+Alt+P** save what the glasses show to `Pictures\XrealScreen\XrealScreen <date time>.png` (`GlassesScreenshot` → `ScreenCapture`: GDI BitBlt of the glasses monitor after DWM composition + WinRT PNG encoder); also `xrs capture glasses [--out <folder>]`. [verified-local] with the CLI on the 1S (3840×1080 PNG); app button/hotkey not yet tested. Repo screenshots in `images/` (all pages, `glasses-anchor.png`, README hero `glasses-workspace.png`); README rewritten with the current features.
- Pitfall: building `src/XrealScreen.App` while the app runs re-registers the dev package and kills the app without cleanup (leftover virtual monitors) — run `xrs recover`.
- 102/102 tests.

## Next 3 steps
1. M6: user test of tray icon / start with Windows / Ctrl+Alt+W (2026-09-27) and of saved workspaces / import-export / start latest workspace / Exit / start on glasses connect / primary screen / window move (2026-09-29).
2. M7: clean-PC install test in Windows Sandbox (`installer\test\Start-SandboxTest.ps1` -> `artifacts\sandbox\results\report.txt`). **First run 2026-09-27 stalled** right after "PASS no driver before install", inside `Install-XrealScreen.ps1 -Yes` (no output for 9 min) - probably a dialog in the Sandbox (driver install prompt or Add-AppxPackage). Next: look at the Sandbox window, log each install step separately with timeouts in `Run-InSandbox.ps1`, rerun. Then trusted signing for a public release.
3. App head tracking: glasses A/B of prediction 20 vs 26 ms (measured latch→scan-out ≈ 22 ms, ADR-0009); optional Strong vs Balanced for the last nod bob. Removing DWM (always composed here) needs exclusive fullscreen or DirectComposition — deferred.

## Blockers
- None.

## Open questions / known gaps
- virtual-display-rs is installed on this PC by VertoXR (self-signed); distribution/signing for other PCs → M7 (ADR-0008).
- In App head tracking, partial axis modes (YawRoll/YawPitch) can cause motion sickness; Full felt best; lag is now "a little" (2026-09-27). Glasses anchor avoids this.
- `missed` frame counter in presenter stats is noisy; p99 frame time is the reliable number.
- Control port 52999 not implemented (glasses-side recenter/UltraWide switching from the app would need it).
- Real lean tracking needs a camera (roadmap "Later").

## Last hardware verification
- **2026-09-26 · XREAL 1S · PID 0x043E · fw 15.01.03.522** — NCM link, ports, IMU framing/units/axes, live tracking in app. Details: `docs/findings/xreal-one-protocol.md`, `docs/findings/xreal-1s-hardware.md`.
- **2026-09-27 · XREAL 1S · fw 15.01.03.522** — App head tracking lag A/B (latch/prediction) and nod A/B (tilt-correction rate gate); nod IMU fixture recorded.
- **2026-09-26/27 · XREAL 1S · fw 15.01.03.522** — both workspace types in the glasses with the user: anchor split 2×/3× screens with gap in 32:9 and 21:9, UltraWide auto-restart, app head tracking comfort A/B, mouse, crash recovery.
