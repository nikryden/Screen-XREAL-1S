# Findings

Facts gathered by research and hardware tests. Every claim carries a tag:

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `[verified-hw]` | Observed on real glasses by us (note date, device, firmware) |
| `[verified-local]` | Observed on the development PC |
| `[from-source:MIT]` | Read in a permissively licensed source (listed in `docs/legal/SOURCES.md`) |
| `[from-GPL:facts-only]` | Fact (ID, port, constant) from a GPL source; no code used |
| `[from-sdk:facts-only]` | Fact from the XREAL SDK (no license; never redistributed) |
| `[hypothesis]` | Unverified; must be confirmed before relying on it |

When a hypothesis is confirmed or refuted, edit the line in place (change the tag, add date) — do not append contradicting notes.
